Known Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Phase I of Zabbix is included as an
:ref:`Experimental<experimental-features-term>` feature
in Mirantis OpenStack.
This version has the following known issues:

- The Zabbix-server role must be installed on a dedicated node;
  it cannot be combined with any other role.
- Phase I does not support Ceilometer, Savanna, Murano, Heat, or Ceph.
- Zabbix agents cannot be configured to report
  to a remote (outside the current environment) Zabbix server
- Zabbix agents cannot be configured to report
  to multiple Zabbix servers.
- There are false Zabbix issues after deploying with Nova-network.
  This can be resolved via attaching "Template App OpenStack Nova Network" to compute nodes
  instead of controller nodes. See `LP1365171 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1365171>`_.

See :ref:`zabbix-plan` for more information.
